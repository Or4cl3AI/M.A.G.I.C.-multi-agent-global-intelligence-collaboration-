    ("main.py", "Main entry of the application, initializes all modules and starts the learning process."),
    ("genetic_algorithm.py", "Implements the GeneticAlgorithm class, which handles the evolution of the neural network."),
    ("neural_network.py", "Implements the NeuralNetwork class, which handles training and prediction."),
    ("dynamic_layer.py", "Implements the DynamicLayer class, which generates dynamic layers for the neural network."),
    ("learning_paradigm.py", "Implements the LearningParadigm class, which handles the switching of learning paradigms."),
    ("user_interface.py", "Implements the UserInterface class, which handles task input, progress monitoring, and feedback provision."),
    ("memory_module.py", "Implements the MemoryModule class, which stores learned information.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "genetic_algorithm.py",
    "neural_network.py",
    "dynamic_layer.py",
    "learning_paradigm.py",
    "memory_module.py",
    "user_interface.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'genetic_algorithm.py' and 'neural_network.py' files are the core of the application, as they handle the evolution and training of the neural network. These should be implemented first, followed by the 'dynamic_layer.py' and 'learning_paradigm.py' files, which handle the dynamic generation of layers and the switching of learning paradigms, respectively. The 'memory_module.py' file, which stores learned information, should be implemented next. Finally, the 'user_interface.py' file, which handles task input, progress monitoring, and feedback provision, and the 'main.py' file, which is the main entry of the application, should be implemented.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points at this moment. The project requirements and design are well-defined.
